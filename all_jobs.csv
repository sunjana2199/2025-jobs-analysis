The technology complexity involved is enormous, given that the Mastercard Data Warehouse is the largest shared service of the company, in terms of size of the data assets, the number of physical servers, the number of transactions stored, and how many products and lines of business leverage the data in the warehouse. This role will help lead the continued evolution and modernization of our data platforms and data engineering practices to ensure Mastercard stays at the competitive forefront in the industry.

o As the technical architect, this role will drive the vision and architectural design, including dependent services, service interactions, and policies.
o This includes identifying ways to make demonstrable progress in the short-term, while keeping an eye on the vision to ensure we are setting ourselves up for long-term success.
o Be the “technical face” of the Data Platforms and Engineering Services team across Mastercard and be able to easily translate and present complex technical topics to senior business leaders.
o Challenge the status quo where necessary and build consensus around those differential opinions.
- Partner on critical efforts and liaise across Mastercard –
o Work closely with team members on all vendor evaluations and be a key stakeholder and voice in any build vs. buy decisions.
o Consult across teams and across program lines to identify synergies and reuse opportunities.
- Solve tough problems and pave the path for team members –
o Lead projects to prototype and prove concepts for new technologies, application frameworks, and design patterns.
o Ensure that solutions are built for scale and are applicable on our hybrid public-private cloud environment, addressing the needs of all relevant stakeholders (including M&As).
o Tackle intrinsically hard problems, venturing beyond comfortable approaches when necessary, and are adept at “Thoughtful Risk Taking”.
o Balance trade-offs between competing interests; adapt approach to meet the needs of the team, project, and product; bring clarity to complexity and demonstrate smart ways to simplify.
o Have strong ownership of the team’s software and be deep in the maintenance characteristics, runtime properties and dependencies including hardware, operating system, and build.
- Learn, educate, mentor, and lead –
o Conduct technical interviews for hiring engineering staff and raising the performance bar.
o Mentor, guide, and coach software engineers and leads in the team to improve engineering productivity, quality, and technology policy compliance.
o Work with existing Principals and management to set engineering principles and federate them throughout the program
o Assist people managers in the talent management process in hiring strong engineering talent and running performance evaluations.
o Seek technical knowledge and educate the team about trends, technologies, and approaches.
o Engage with external technical communities to extend our reach and benefit from the discovery outside of Mastercard and our industry.

EMPLOYEE ROLE
Individual Contributor

The Opportunity

We seek a senior, experienced ‘hands-on’ analytics engineer to join our Customer Engineering team within the Adobe Digital Experience (DX) Cloud Engineering. Customer Engineering (CE) focuses on multiple aspects of product experience for Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) and AEP-related Apps, including diagnostics and prevention of customer issues and technical enablement to help customers quickly and iteratively move through the product adoption lifecycle to realize business value. The CE team also partners closely with our Adobe Field teams (Pre-Sales, Consulting, and Support) Field and 3rd party partners to collect and synthesize real-world customer patterns to align our product roadmap and develop technical frameworks and tooling to help these field teams achieve scale and impact as they engage with customers.

As our AEP business grows, our product and broader engineering teams are challenged to scale themselves to meet the customer and field team demands. In particular, various teams need data-driven, actionable insights that help identify, prioritize, and focus people and technology investments to help customers struggling to run, operate, or grow business impact from their AEP E2E system. In addition, there is ample opportunity to infuse more customer self-serve intelligence into our products through reporting, analytics, and even AI assistance. This senior analytics engineer would be one of the founding members of a Customer Data Science & Analytics team to take on these challenges – requiring this person to model and deliver critical data sets that support new cross-product & engineering KPI reporting, predictive intelligence (e.g., at-risk customers, customer maturity, etc.), and in-product usage and value frameworks. This role will collaborate closely with data science colleagues and other internal cross-team data engineers, ML ops, and decision science platform teams.

What You’ll Do
• Create and maintain complex data models and queries to support cross-AEP analytics, dashboards, and self-serve tools
• Collaborate with stakeholders to understand business requirements and translate them into data insights reporting & analytics solutions
• Establish data modeling standards and patterns; ensure these models accurately measure KPIs, metrics, and supporting details.
• Build and maintain data pipelines and infrastructure for efficient data processing and analysis

177,7,Principal Data Engineer- Secureworks- 100% Remote,Dell Technologies,Anywhere,via Karkidi,"100% Remote to United States Based candidates

We are the engineering team behind Taegis , a Security Platform-as-a-Service that is beautiful, simple and a delight to use. We protect organizations by providing battle-tested, best-in-class cybersecurity solutions that reduce risks, improve security operations, and accelerate return on investment for Security and Information Technology teams.

We are hiring a senior engineer to work on our Taegis platform. You will be working on a cross-functional team that is completely remote. Ideally, you have worked on maintaining data pipelines at scale preferably using Kafka and Spark. Our technology stack is hosted in AWS (Amazon Web Services). We want to find motivated individuals who want to do their best work rather than finding someone who has done this before. If you have a curious mindset, and the drive to get things done you will fit right in.

You will be working with us on the Dataflow team. The Dataflow team is responsible for ensuring ingested customer data is trustworthy, resilient, and securely accessible to customers and applications. You will have plenty of opportunities to add your own input into our software.

We host bi-annual weeklong hackathons to display your creative and innovative side. We have components that started as hackathon projects that are now empowering the Taegis platform.

We are looking for individuals that are curious, eager to learn and are diligent and kind. Our teams work well because we place trust in them to succeed. As a senior engineer we expect you to help elevate the skills of the team through technical mentorship. We would love you to show us how we can improve what we do.

You have about five years' industry experience, but we care less about how long you have been active and more about what you have done. We believe in radical candor and healthy debate. We like strong opinions loosely held. You should be comfortable working with remote employees, which means using video calls and frequent written communication.

Technologies and skills required to get the job done
• Knowledge of data ingest techniques (e.g., historical vs. stream processing) and related technologies (e.g., Hudi, Apache Flink, Spark, Spark Streaming, Kafka-Connect)
• Performance tuning Spark or Flink jobs
• Performance turning large scale Kafka Clusters
• Java, Scala, Golang

At Netflix, our mission is to entertain the world. With 278 million paid members in over 190 countries on millions of devices; enjoying TV series, documentaries, and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages - Netflix is reinventing entertainment from end to end. We are revolutionizing how shows and movies are produced, pushing technological boundaries to efficiently deliver streaming video at a massive scale over the internet, and continuously improving the end-to-end user experience with Netflix across their member journey.

We pride ourselves on using data to inform our decision-making as we work towards our mission. This requires curating data across various domains such as Growth, Finance, Product, Content, and Studio. All of this data collection and curation is made possible thanks to the amazing Data Engineers of Netflix who bring this data to life.

Netflix is one of the world's leading entertainment services, with 283 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.

Netflix is revolutionizing entertainment and shaping the evolution of storytelling around the world with over 270 million members in 190 countries.

We are focused on delivering an incredible customer experience, and when a Netflix member has a problem using Netflix, we want to quickly and thoroughly resolve their issue and get them back to streaming. Customer Service is one of the few areas where we hear directly from our members, and we engage with millions of them via phone and chat in 25 different languages. Within Data Science and Engineering (DSE), we use data to rigorously measure, optimize, and personalize our Customer Service investments to enable a delightful, efficient experience and to improve our product based on what our members tell us.

In this role, you’ll collaborate with data engineers, software engineers, and CS business owners to build reliable, scalable data pipelines, transform raw data into core business metrics, and work with custom visualization tools that surface CS insights. The team is small, so the role requires a high degree of autonomy, strong technical judgment, and the ability to span across the data stack, from pipeline development to business metrics and tools.

We’re looking for:
• At least 4 years of experience engineering data pipelines using big data technologies (Hive, Presto, Spark, Flink) on medium to large-scale data sets (10s of millions of records).
• Strong data modeling skills. You design structures that are adaptable to changes in the source data or business processes.
• Strong proficiency in Python or Scala and passion for writing clean, supportable code.
• Advanced SQL skills and advocacy for data quality.
• Analytical aptitude to think through business problems (e.g. metrics development) and prioritize autonomously.
• Strong communication and productive partnership with analysts, engineers, business leaders.

About the job

Airbnb was born in 2007 when two Hosts welcomed three guests to their San Francisco home, and has since grown to over 4 million Hosts who have welcomed more than 1 billion guest arrivals in almost every country across the globe. Every day, Hosts offer unique stays and experiences that make it possible for guests to connect with communities in a more authentic way.

The Community You Will Join:

At Airbnb, we want to build a world where anyone can belong anywhere – and the first step in that direction is creating a community that’s open, inclusive, and built on trust. In a world where our digital presence and identity is as important as our physical presence, we believe that a fundamental part of earning this trust is by ensuring that we protect our users, the data they entrust to us, and our infrastructure. At Airbnb, our Information Security practices, and resulting trust, are part of the reason users choose to use and continue using our products.

The Information Security team plays a critical role in maintaining and building our community’s trust in our platform that enables millions of users to explore the world and belong anywhere. As a critical horizontal function within Airbnb, Information Security spans the scope of the company and organizations that make it up to secure Airbnb giving anyone who joins the team the ability to see all aspects of the business.

The Difference You Will Make:

We are looking for a Senior Staff Machine Learning Engineer to contribute to advancing Information Security protections and related operations across a variety of domains such as Identity and Access Management, Insider Risk, and device protections through the use of data analytics, machine learning, and related emerging tech such as genAI and LLMs. You will partner across the Information Security team along with cross-functional engineering and business organizations to achieve the strategic priorities that secure Airbnb for your area of focus.

A Typical Day:
• Support, scale, and advance security or related functions through practical applied uses of data analytics, ML models, and integration of genAI and LLM models from past experience at equivalent size, scope, scale, and technically complex companies comparable to Airbnb.
• Provide strategic approaches and methodologies to advance security disciplines working with large scale structured and unstructured data, build, and continuously improve cutting edge Machine Learning models for these disciplines.
• Continuously identify, drive, and support opportunities where Information Security disciplines can benefit from your area of expertise. Work collaboratively with cross-functional partners including software engineers, product managers, operations, and data scientists to do so.
• Work through ambiguity to detailed solutions. You can and support others to take a vague problem, crisply frame the challenge, what’s being solved for, identify a path forward, and drive an initiative over the finish-line.
• You have a demonstrated ability to see the interconnectedness of not only the immediate problem you’re solving for, but also those of other organizations to unify cross-functional stakeholders to deliver solutions that are best for Airbnb vs. a single business unit.
• Self-motivated, proactive and proven ability to adapt well and work with teams having different operating cadences and breadth of subject matter backgrounds.
• Provide sound business judgment, a proven ability to influence others, strong analytical skills, and a track record of taking ownership, leading data driven analyses, and influencing results.
• Develop processes where little exists across large organizations, and demonstrated flexibility to get things done.
• Drive technology changes to improve capabilities to protect Airbnb in your area of expertise.

Your Expertise:
• 12+ years of industry experience in applied Machine Learning
• A Bachelor’s, Master’s, or PhD in CS/ML or related field
• Strong programming (Scala / Python / Java/ C++ or equivalent) and data engineering skills
• Deep understanding of Machine Learning best practices (eg. training/serving skew minimization, A/B test, feature engineering, feature/model selection), algorithms (eg. gradient boosted trees, neural networks/deep learning, optimization) and domains (eg. natural language processing, computer vision, personalization and recommendation, anomaly detection)
• Experience with 3 or more of these technologies: Tensorflow, PyTorch, Kubernetes, Spark, Airflow (or equivalent), Kafka (or equivalent), data warehouse (eg. Hive)
• Industry experience building end-to-end Machine Learning infrastructure and/or building and productionizing Machine Learning models
• Exposure to architectural patterns of a large, high-scale software applications (e.g., well-designed APIs, high volume data pipelines, efficient algorithms, models)
• Experience with test driven development, familiar with A/B testing, incremental delivery and deployment.
• Experience with Information Security or similar domains.
• You have experience in developing and communicating effective and pragmatic strategies that you are directly responsible for and help engineering and business team(s) execute on. You don’t wait for things to happen to you, you make things happen. You feel personally responsible for the success of the initiative you are driving regardless of who is doing the work. You see beyond your immediate disciplines to tie together the needed end-to-end elements that will successfully sustain the capabilities you establish to achieve the unified objectives in support of the broader Information Security strategy at Airbnb.
• You have strong written and verbal communication skills. You can dive into the details with engineers and business partners while also speaking at the appropriate altitude when working with other organizations and leaders up to and including the executive level. You have empathy and seek to understand before being understood when communicating. This enables you to effectively identify the best path forward and influence how you approach a problem as well as how other teams may prioritize supporting the initiatives you are directly responsible for.

About Shopify

Opportunity is not evenly distributed. Shopify puts independence within reach for anyone with a dream to start a business. Since 2006, we’ve grown to over 10,000 employees and generated over $500 billion in sales for millions of merchants in 175 countries. Every 28 seconds, an entrepreneur on Shopify makes their first sale.

This is life-defining work that directly impacts people’s lives as much as it transforms your own. This is putting the power of the few in the hands of the many, is a future with more voices rather than fewer, and is creating more choices instead of an elite option.

About you

Moving at our pace brings a lot of change, complexity, and ambiguity—and a little bit of chaos. Shopifolk thrive on that and are comfortable being uncomfortable. That means Shopify is not the right place for everyone.

Before you apply, consider if you can:
• Care deeply about what you do and about making commerce better for everyone
• Excel by seeking professional and personal hypergrowth
• Keep up with an unrelenting pace (the week, not the quarter)
• Be resilient and resourceful in face of ambiguity and thrive on (rather than endure) change
• Bring critical thought and opinion — and embrace differences and disagreement to get shit done and move forward
• Work digital-first for your daily work

Some additional context on the role:

We are in need of a seasoned Business Intelligence engineer to aid in supporting (short term) and redesigning (longer term) our data and reporting for business consumption.

Our current BI stack suffers from legacy business logic being defined and maintained throughout the BI stack.

In the short term, we are looking for an individual to spend discovery time with business SMEs in S&OP and Finance to gain understanding of their usage of our existing data.

From here, we would request support for these SMEs when there are issues with reporting or data.

The other short term deliverable after discovery would be a plan forward on the architecture and technology to best support these aspects of our business.

Current technology/systems used:

Sources of Truth for Orders/Inventory: NetSuite (inbound and outbound inventory) & Shopify (sales) -- Shopify and Netsuite are connected via Celigo tooling

Pipelines: Stitch, Hevo

Transformation: dbt

Data Visualization: Looker

258,8,"Senior Software Engineer, Fullstack (CDP API)",Coinbase Developer Platform,"San Francisco, CA",via Greenhouse,"The Coinbase Developer Platform APIs are the easiest way for developers to get started with building crypto applications. Conceived by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, these APIs enable those with no prior knowledge of crypto to begin sending and receiving crypto in as little as 30 seconds. A top priority of the Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP), the CDP APIs encapsulate some of the most cutting-edge technologies in crypto by externalizing Coinbase’s internal services, built over more than a decade of experience. The CDP APIs combine custodial and non-custodial wallets into one clean abstraction, making interactions with the blockchain simple and painless.

The CDP API team owns both server-side APIs and client-side libraries across different languages. The team seeks a full-stack engineer who is passionate about all aspects of excellent developer experiences: authoring clear and informative documentation, building compelling sample applications, interacting directly with customers to incorporate feedback, architecting delightfully simple SDKs, etc. The engineer must be comfortable operating in both frontend and backend codebases, fluent across a variety of programming languages, and demonstrate both high code velocity and quality simultaneously. The CDP API team consists of some of the most prolific and tenured software engineers at Coinbase, and is excited to ship a game-changing set of APIs and SDKs at breakneck speed.

• Develop secure and scalable key management systems, packaged as Docker images, to enable crypto wallet functionality across a range of custodial configurations (e.g. self-custodial MPC)
• Work closely with many different teams at Coinbase to externalize their backend services through the CDP APIs, ensuring consistency of concepts, style, and design
• Interface directly with customers to collect their feedback and iteratively improve the CDP APIs and SDKs
• Build compelling sample applications end-to-end using the CDP APIs and SDKs to demonstrate their value and pressure-test the developer experience
• Troubleshoot and debug complex fullstack issues, ensuring stability, reliability, and security
• Participate in code reviews and provide constructive feedback to maintain high code quality standards

What we look for in you:
• 5+ years of experience in both backend and frontend software development

259,9,"Staff Detection Engineer, Insider Threat",Coinbase,Anywhere,via Startup Jobs,"At Coinbase, our mission is to increase economic freedom around the world, and we couldn’t do this without hiring the best people. We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Most importantly, we seek people who are excited about crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We’re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.

Who you are:

• You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there.
• You’re never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0.
• You appreciate direct communication. You’re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let’s face it, you can’t have one without the other. You’re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
• You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
• You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
• You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.
Security is a primary competency at Coinbase, and the Security Operations team keeps a watchful eye over every aspect of it. Every day, we go to battle against some of the most sophisticated attackers in the world to protect billions of dollars worth of digital assets and ensure that our customers and employees can enjoy a safe, trusted experience. As Coinbase scales globally, our team is scaling along with it, using a blend of tooling, automation, and strategic team growth to ensure that we’re well-equipped to protect the next billion users of crypto.

What you’ll be doing (ie. job duties):

The Security Operations group is a multi-functional organization that includes our CSIRT, Trust & Safety, Threat Intelligence, and Insider Threat. While no two days will end up looking the same, generally-speaking you’ll be responsible for the following things:

• Building and implementing detections, preventions, security controls, and automations to not only deter insider threats but improve holistic security posture
• Testing and maintaining security tooling, particularly for endpoint detection and investigation
• Collaborating cross-functionally with Security, Infrastructure, IT, and Legal to obtain necessary technical information and to evaluate and advise them of downstream impacts of their builds/deployments
• Linking disparate information such that it can be aggregated, visualized, and interpreted for indications of threat (via query builds, table joins, etc.)
• Assisting with investigations as needed (this may involve rapidly building tools or extending capabilities to aid response efforts).

What we look for in you (ie. job requirements):

You’ll be much more likely to be successful in this role if these bullet points seem like a good description of you:

• You have experience designing and implementing Insider Threat technologies (such as Security Information Event Management - SIEM, User Behavioral Analytics - UBA, Data Loss Prevention - DLP) and an understanding of investigations and/or the intelligence cycle
• You are comfortable manipulating logs, tables, and data lakes to engineer custom detections and dashboards
• You’ve mastered SQL and coding languages like Python and regularly manipulate logs to create custom alerts and automations with SOAR
• You are comfortable working cross-functionally with infrastructure, IT, and response teams to design and implement technical controls
• You are actively aware of the insider threat landscape, and understand the legal, regulatory, and ethical considerations of working with sensitive information and situations
• You are discreet, thoughtful, and seek to coordinate systemic, cross functional solutions to mitigate risk
• You are adept at translating complex problems into ‘byte-sized’, readily implemented (and preferably automated) solutions
• You have excellent verbal and written communication skills. Other team members ask for your input to communicate clearly and concisely and you are comfortable composing briefs and assessments consumed by leadership and training others
• You prefer to play as a team and are equally comfortable as the ‘novice’ or the ‘expert’
• You know that people aren’t stupid, but everyone makes mistakes. Your high degree of empathy means that your coworkers trust you to help tackle their security problems, because you never come across as judgmental or condescending.
• You are a unicorn who is equally comfortable behind the keyboard or in front of security leaders
• You bring 5-10 years or more of combined experience in security/technology or other analytic roles

Nice to haves:

• Unicorns welcome! You would bring a diverse perspective to the team: for example, maybe you took an unconventional route to get into your current security career.
• You’re familiar with blockchains, cryptocurrency, and onchain projects (or at least a good story about how you thought about investing in Bitcoin in 2014 but decided not to).
• You love crafting metrics that make the intangible tangible
• You’ve got experience in one or more of the following areas: incident response, data protection, risk management, counterintelligence, fraud detection, intellectual property theft, access and identity management, or IT engineering

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

The team is responsible for offering data warehouse analytics capabilities for Stripe and the stack is supported by a collection of internally developed services and several popular open source technologies like Trino/Presto, Hive Metastore, etc. The systems we own support all of the data warehouse workloads initiated by both services and by individual Stripes across the company to support various business analytics use cases. We process hundreds of thousands of queries on petabytes of data per day and form the key data serving layer for one of the largest financial data lakes in the world. The team is distributed across USA and Canada.

What you’ll do

You will work as a Technical lead for the data warehouse analytics space and will be a key contributor to the evolution of our platform. You will directly influence how Stripe analyzes its vast and ever growing data lake. As a Staff Engineer, you’ll be empowered to make decisions with a large impact on Stripe. You will guide our investments and strategy while making our systems reliable, secure, and a delight to use. Staff Engineers at Stripe are expected and empowered to operate autonomously and are counted on to help drive Stripe forward. In this role, you will work closely and frequently with the other tech staff & senior leadership across Stripe’s data platform and have opportunities to significantly influence the overall data strategy for Stripe. We’re looking for people with a strong background and demonstrated leadership in data platform technologies.

Responsibilities
• Scope and lead large technical projects with enormous impact for Engineers & business within Stripe.
• Build and maintain the infrastructure which powers the core of Stripe.
• Scrutinize and reason clearly about the technology and architecture choices we make in building these products. In many cases, you will be the decision maker.
• Directly contribute to core interface design and write code. Serve as a role model for how great software should be written for Stripe as a whole.
• Arbitrate critical decisions correctly that fully consider software best practices, Stripe system realities, and numerous stakeholders’ preferences and concerns.
• Advise Stripe’s leadership team on key technical considerations related to data storage and access within Stripe.
• Work closely with the open source community to identify opportunities for adopting new open source features as well contribute back to the OSS.
• Work effectively cross functionally.
• Teach and mentor the next generation of technical leaders at Stripe.

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements
• Strong technical background with 10+ years of experience in data platforms, distributed systems, and backend development.
• Experience using, operating and optimizing distributed SQL query engines like Trino/Presto
• Experience managing and scaling data warehouse systems like Hive Metastore or AWS Glue Data Catalog.
• Experience with data lake architectures and hands-on experience with data lake open table formats such as Parquet, Iceberg, Delta lake, Hudi, etc.
• Strong programming skills in at least one JVM language (Java, Scala) and proficiency in SQL. Experience with Golang or Python is a plus.
• Excellent problem-solving skills and experience in troubleshooting complex distributed systems.
• Track record of serving as a technical lead, with the ability to provide technical direction and mentor team members.
• Strong communication skills with the ability to explain complex technical concepts to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
• Demonstrated ability to work cross-functionally, collaborating effectively with data engineers, data scientists, and business stakeholders.
• Ability to listen and synthesize ideas from across the organization while setting a compelling technical vision.

Preferred Qualifications
• Have been a Staff, Principal, or Distinguished Engineer at a top tier company.
• Have owned the technical roadmap for a business area.
• Are often cited as the inspiration for engineers that join your teams. Even senior engineers feel that they’re able to learn from you.

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $209,800 - $314,800. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.","[{'title':

263,3,"Staff Full Stack Engineer, Data Products",Stripe,"New York, NY",via LinkedIn,"About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

At Stripe, we are building a powerful suite of Data Products that enable all Stripes to understand, analyze, and take action based on data and metrics. As a Full Stack Engineer in our Data Products Workbench Team, you will play a crucial role in developing high leverage tooling and user interfaces for data visualization and analysis, all of which are critical to driving data literacy, empowering decision-making, and improving ML model performance across the organization. The team is part of the Data Platform Products organization and our long-term vision is to build a unified data product development experience at Stripe.

What you’ll do

Joining our Data Products Workbench Team means being part of an innovative and diverse team working on impactful projects that empower the entire Stripe organization. You will have the opportunity to shape the future of data-driven decision-making and help build world-class data products. If you have a passion for data, analytics, and delivering high-quality software, we would love to hear from you.

Responsibilities
• Build and launch new capabilities and products that bring significant value to users
• Work with a wide range of systems, processes and technologies to own and solve technical and product problems
• Design, develop, and maintain robust and scalable user interfaces and backend systems for our Data Products, ensuring high performance, accessibility, and responsiveness.
• Uphold our high engineering standards, and elevate quality and engineering efficiency within our many codebases and processes
• Collaborate with stakeholders across the organization including dependency engineering teams, product, design, infrastructure, and operations
• Mentor engineers earlier in their technical careers to help them grow

Who you are

We’re looking for people with a strong background or interest in building successful products; you’re passionate about solving business problems and making impact, you are comfortable in dealing with lots of moving pieces; and you’re comfortable learning new technologies and systems.

Minimum Requirements
• Have a strong technical background, including 3+ years of experience working on full stack code bases and doing anything it takes to solve problems and delight users.
• Proficiency in front end technologies (HTML/CSS/Typescript/React/Redux/REST APIs).
• Experience with server-side programming using languages like Python, Node.js, or Go.
• Prefer simple solutions and designs over complex ones, and have a good intuition for what will last and scale.
• Are motivated by solving hard problems, and measure your success in terms of impact doing so.
• Thrive in a highly collaborative environment involving different stakeholders and subject matter experts.

Preferred Qualifications
• Experience of building front end technologies involving data-oriented products or analytics tools.
• Experience with data visualization libraries such as D3.js, Highcharts, or Plotly, and an understanding of principles of effective data visualization.
• Familiarity with relational and non-relational databases, and ability to design and optimize data schemas to support efficient querying and data processing, optimizing data pipelines, and ensuring seamless data flow across systems.

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $209,800 - $314,800. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.","[{'title': 'Qualifications', 'items': ['We’re looking for people with a strong background or interest in building successful products;

Technologies we use include: Golang, Ruby, MongoDB, MySQL, Vitess, Envoy, Kafka, and others.

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location.

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About the team

Before Stripe, every growing internet platform had a payments team. Today, every growing internet platform has an Identity team. Stripe Identity is building a service that enables merchants to seamlessly verify their customers while scaling globally with ease. We believe Identity is a core piece of economic infrastructure for online businesses, just like payments.

Great Identity solutions not only enable complex, highly regulated businesses to work with ease on the internet, but they also effectively keep merchants and consumers in the internet economy. Stripe Identity’s mission is to become the easiest way to verify a real-world identity on the internet.

We are looking for Machine Learning Engineers to own the end-to-end lifecycle of applied ML model development and deployment in service of consumer facing products like Stripe Identity and Link. You will partner with ML engineers, product engineers, and xfn partners to define the scope of high-impact ML projects - from ideation to execution.

Responsibilities
• Design and deploy new models using tools such as XGBoost, Tensorflow, PyTorch and iteratively improve identity verification and fraud models to protect millions of users from fraud
• Work with huge payment datasets to find creative new methods of detecting and deterring fraudulent behavior
• Propose new feature ideas and design real-time data pipelines to incorporate them into our models
• Improve the way we evaluate and monitor our model and system performance
• Envision and develop new models for fraud detection
• Work with product and engineering partners, as well as risk and policy teams to build solutions that fit product needs
• Collaborate with stakeholders and drive end-to-end projects involving a variety of technologies and systems to successful completion

Hybrid work at Stripe

Our Chicago, Dublin, and Singapore teams spend at least 50% of their time in their local offices. We believe that more in-person interactions will contribute to better results for our employees and Stripe.

Project Galileo: We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers--at no cost.

Athenian Project: We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.

1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever.

Cloudflare helps build the future of the Internet. We started Cloudflare to solve one half of every IT organization's challenge: how do you ensure the resources and infrastructure that you expose to the Internet are safe from attack, fast, and reliable. We saw that the world was moving away from hardware and software to solve these problems and instead wanted a scalable service that would work around the world.

To deliver that, we built one of the world's largest networks. Today our network spans more than 300 cities worldwide and is within milliseconds of nearly everyone connected to the Internet. We have built the capacity to stand up to nation-state scale cyberattacks and a threat intelligence system powered by the immense amount of Internet traffic that we see.

We have recently expanded Cloudflare’s product offerings to solve the other half of every IT organization's challenge: ensuring the people and teams within an organization can access the tools they need to do their jobs and are safe from malware and other online threats. To do that, we released Cloudflare’s SSE and SASE services, a Zero Trust platform built on Cloudflare’s network to secure users, devices, and data in organizations of any size. Cloudflare for Teams consists of multiple products that deliver a comprehensive solution. Part of this suite is Cloudflare Data Loss Prevention which helps protect sensitive data uniformly across all networks, SaaS applications, users and devices.

Cloudflare’s DLP product helps customers of any size protect the data that powers their business. Whether credit card numbers, health records, trade secrets or other types of data, Cloudflare’s solution allows organizations to focus on their business and stop worrying about applying bandaids to protect their data. The solution runs in-line with Secure Web Gateway, Cloud Access Security Broker and Remote Browser Isolation - layering Zero Trust access control and web filtering as part of a defense-in-depth approach to data security.

Responsibilities

We are looking for a talented, experienced software engineer to join our team and help take our Data Loss Prevention product to the next level. You’ll help us make our DLP product more efficient and more accurate, while also helping us build out more features. You’ll contribute to the design and implementation of a Rust codebase that is deployed across Cloudflare’s entire edge fleet, and in Kubernetes clusters in our core datacenters.

Technologies we use
• Core edge services are written in Rust and deployed globally to 300+ data centers.
• Our REST API is also written in Rust, runs on Kubernetes, and uses Postgres as a data store.
• For service monitoring we use Prometheus and Grafana
• For service logging we use Elasticsearch and Kibana
• For product analytics we use Clickhouse and BigQuery

Skills and Knowledge we’d love for you to have
• Solid Rust coding experience (the entire product is written in Rust)
• Container orchestration (e.g. k8s)
• Distributed systems (performance, consistency, observability, resilience)
• Advanced data/document classification (e.g. statistical, ML)

Compensation

Compensation may be adjusted depending on work location. There are multiple levels open on the team, both mid & senior level.

Senior Level (4)
• For Bay Area-based hires: Estimated annual salary of $196,000 - $240,000

What Makes Cloudflare Special?

We’re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We’re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.

Project Galileo: We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers--at no cost.

Athenian Project: We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.

1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

Sound like something you’d like to be a part of? We’d love to hear from you!

What Makes Cloudflare Special?

We’re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We’re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.

Project Galileo: We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers--at no cost.

Athenian Project: We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.

1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

337,9,Principal Site Reliability Engineer,Atlassian,"Mountain View, CA",via Ladders,"Overview

Working at Atlassian

Atlassians can choose where they work - whether in an office, from home, or a combination of the two. That way, Atlassians have more control over supporting their family, personal goals, and other priorities. We can hire people in any country where we have a legal entity. Interviews and onboarding are conducted virtually, a part of being a distributed-first company.

Responsibilities

We are looking for a reliability expert who is passionate about scaling Cloud services to join our growing SRE teams. An ideal candidate is someone who is aware of current industry trends (particularly those related to reliability) and who thrives on working with a diverse set of partners, who can articulate the business impact of a problem and can also dive deep into the technical solution.

We'd love it if you brought a deep understanding of modern Cloud infrastructure, programming expertise, operational experience and a desire to change the status quo. We're looking for an engineer who can analyse and help improve our services and processes to get us to an even higher level of reliability, performance, scalability, and cost efficiency. You'll achieve this by crossing team and functional boundaries to advocate for reliability methodologies and will work with a variety of platform, product and SRE teams to both build reliability into our platform and drive adoption of those practices into our products. In other words, you'll be the driving force for change! You will report directly to a Senior Engineering Manager.

Qualifications

On your first day, we'll expect you to have:
• Expert-level proficiency with 8+ years experience in at least Java.
• Expert-level proficiency with 5+ years experience in public cloud offerings (AWS components like EC2, CloudFormation, RDS / Aurora, Caches, SQS - or equivalents, e.g. in GCP / Azure).
• Expert-level proficiency with 5+ years experience in operating high-availability, fault-tolerant, scalable, distributed software in production: building monitoring into your code, tweaking dashboards, defining alerts, writing runbooks, etc.
• Experience in driving large, complex, cross-organizational initiatives from inception to completion.
• Excellent communication skills in written and verbal forms, and an ability to communicate complex technical issues to a range of technical and non-technical audiences (management, peers, clients).
• Experience in leadership positions, able to influence others and drive impactful outcomes through delegation.
• An ability and desire to mentor and coach engineers.

It would be great, but not mandatory if you had:
• Expertise in datastores (RDBMS, time-series-database, NoSql, search, analytics).
• Expertise in JVM, Garbage Collection, and Performance Tuning.

349,1,"Principal Software Engineer, Data Platform (Remote)",CrowdStrike,Anywhere,via Indeed,"As a global leader in cybersecurity, CrowdStrike protects the people, processes and technologies that drive modern organizations. Since 2011, our mission hasn’t changed — we’re here to stop breaches, and we’ve redefined modern security with the world’s most advanced AI-native platform. We work on large scale distributed systems, processing almost 3 trillion events per day. We have 3.44 PB of RAM deployed across our fleet of C* servers - and this traffic is growing daily. Our customers span all industries, and they count on CrowdStrike to keep their businesses running, their communities safe and their lives moving forward. We’re also a mission-driven company. We cultivate an inclusive culture that gives every CrowdStriker both the flexibility and autonomy to own their careers. We’re always looking to add talented CrowdStrikers to the team who have limitless passion, a relentless focus on innovation and a fanatical commitment to our customers, our community and each other. Ready to join a mission that matters? The future of cybersecurity starts with you.

About the Role:

Our Data Platform group at Crowdstrike is unique among its kind for being uncommonly customer-focused. In line with classic Data Platform groups, we build and operate systems to centralize all of the data from Falcon Sensors and 3rd Party sources derived from trillions of events/day. We also drive industry-leading innovation on a hyper scale security data lake that helps find bad actors and stop breaches.

Setting ourselves apart, we also make it easy for all customers to utilize the platform for batch and streaming analytics, machine learning and threat hunting through the production and delivery of self-service platforms (Query Platform, Analytics Platform, Enrichment platform...) based respectively upon Spark and Flink as the runtime(s). These self-service platforms allow customers to apply their own custom schema, syntax, data models (etc.) to our historical cyberattack data, modeling threats in a way that empowers them to predictively build (among other things) behavioral automations that defend against such threats 'before' they appear in their own environments.

In this role, you will be a Principal Engineer (E9 - what would typically be called 'Distinguished Engineer' elsewhere) within Data Platform, owning - in entirely hands-on capacity the design, build and delivery of a new self-service data enrichment platform which will take our customers' proactive defense measures to the next level.

As a leader in data platform, you will contribute to the full spectrum of our systems, including query processing, scalable pipeline builds with largely Apache-based ingestion, materialized view, transformation and data storage frameworks, and tools/applications that make data available to thousands of users and hundreds of internal systems.

What You’ll Do:
• Shape the vision of our Analytics Data Platform for its next phase of growth: building a Unified Data Catalog as well as Query Analysis for structured data stored in different forms (columnar vs graph), and building and optimizing query performance using different techniques of indexing and data partitioning.
• Design, develop, and maintain a data platform that processes petabytes of data

#WeAreCrowdStrike and our mission is to stop breaches. As a global leader in cybersecurity, our team changed the game. Since our inception, our market leading cloud-native platform has offered unparalleled protection against the most sophisticated cyberattacks. We work on large scale distributed systems, processing over 1 trillion events a day with a petabyte of RAM deployed in our Cassandra clusters - and this traffic is growing daily. We’re looking for people with limitless passion, a relentless focus on innovation and a fanatical commitment to developing and shaping our cybersecurity platform. Consistently recognized as a top workplace, CrowdStrike is committed to cultivating an inclusive, remote-first culture that offers people the autonomy and flexibility to balance the needs of work and life while taking their career to the next level. Interested in working for a company that sets the standard and leads with integrity? Join us on a mission that matters - one team, one fight.

About the Role:

Our Ingestion group at Crowdstrike manages all network communications event traffic between our security cloud and customer resources. This means ultra-high volume services (all written in Golang) supported by Kafka, and plenty of work with network connections and protocols (etc. - negotiating TLS, balancing network connections, managing virtual sessions, distributing dynamic content, managing datastreams, and so on).

CrowdStrike is seeking a backend software engineer who wants to grow at scale, is comfortable with being technically stretched, and would like to positively impact our mission to stop breaches. Your experience working with large-scale distributed systems will be applied across a range of services.

What You'll Do:

As a Major Initiative Lead you will have high autonomy with high expectations, often serving as a guiding hand in designing things like proprietary Cloud Protocol(s), and working closely with Falcon Sensor teams for each of the platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android). Your details-oriented mindset and performance focus will allow CrowdStrike to scale into the future. Solid experience with large-scale distributed systems, network protocols, performance optimization, open source tools and libraries and multi-tenant architecture is highly desirable but not required.

If you want a job that makes a difference in the world and operates at high-scale, you’ve come to the right place.

What You'll Need:
• Degree in Computer Science (or commensurate experience in data structures/algorithms/distributed systems).
• Over 7 years' experience in a full-time backend software development role
• Ample experience building high volume services and systems for a cloud-delivered SaaS product
• Solid grounding in the technology of at least one cloud environment (AWS, Azure, GCP)
• The ability to scale backend systems – sharding, partitioning, scaling horizontally are second nature to you.
• The ability to troubleshoot and pinpoint system failures across a pipeline of services.
• The desire to ship code and the love of seeing your bits run in production.
• Deep understanding of distributed systems and scalability challenges, multi-threading, concurrency, and parallel processing technologies.
• Team player skills – we embrace collaborating as a team as much as possible
• A thorough understanding of engineering best practices from appropriate testing paradigms to effective peer code reviews and resilient architecture.
• The ability to thrive in a fast paced, test-driven, collaborative and iterative programming environment.
• The skills to meet your commitments on time and produce high quality software that is unit tested, code reviewed, and checked in regularly for continuous integration.
• Ability to brainstorm, define, and build collaboratively with members across multiple teams.
• Solid design and problem solving skills with demonstrated passion for engineering excellence, quality, security and performance
• Strong cross-group collaboration and interpersonal communication skills working with a variety of roles; including engineering, product management, support and sales engineering

Bonus Points:
• Industry experience in implementing web servers and load balancers
• Authored and lead successful open source libraries and projects
• Contributions to the open source community (GitHub, Stack Overflow, blogging)
• Existing exposure to Go, Scala, AWS, Cassandra, Kafka, Elasticsearch…
• Prior experience in the cybersecurity or intelligence fields

384,6,"Software Engineer, Security Foundations",Lyft,"Seattle, WA",via Startup Jobs,"At Lyft, our mission is to improve people’s lives with the world’s best transportation. To do this, we start with our own community by creating an open, inclusive, and diverse organization.

Lyft connects people to transportation to change the way we live and get around our communities. Lyft’s engineering team is growing rapidly, and we are looking for Software Engineers with a passion in Security to help us scale. Come be part of the Security team at Lyft focused on enabling and empowering engineering teams to deliver secure services at scale.

Our drivers and passengers entrust Lyft with their personal information and travel details to get where they're going and expect us to keep that data safe. Lyft's security team leads efforts across the company to ensure our systems are secure and worthy of our users' trust.

The security team designs and builds Lyft's security architecture, consults with other teams as they build and launch new products and features, proactively plans for the unexpected, and responds to incidents that occur. Our work affects the entire company and takes place at all levels of the stack, from infrastructure to web application security, as well as mobile apps, IT, and autonomous vehicles. We try to approach security from a software engineering standpoint. We believe in scaling security through automation and tooling and we ship frequently. Check out our blog posts at https://eng.lyft.com/tagged/security to learn more about some of the things we’ve built.

We're looking for an engineer who's excited about growing and improving security at Lyft by building systems and promoting security throughout the company. You'll play a part in shaping the future of security at Lyft, and your work will have significant impact and visibility.

Responsibilities:• Architect and build services that improve the security of our systems with an eye towards scalability and avoiding unnecessary friction.
• Evangelize our shared security responsibility model by collaborating with other Infrastructure teams at Lyft to ensure that our services and workflows are secure by default.
• Work on embedding security best practices such as least privilege, isolation, monitoring, authentication and authorization across our infrastructure
• Develop critical services that Lyft depends on such as our credential management service that provides secrets to all our services at Lyft.
• Provide rich data to engineers at Lyft to drive manual and automated decision making by working on our open-source service Cartography, which shows relationships between our infrastructure assets.
• Ensuring least privilege is enforced by improving role-based access control and Identity Access Management for our users and services

Experience:• Solid experience with a high level programming language (bonus points for experience with Python, Go-lang and shell scripts)
• Experience with (or a deep interest in) computer security
• When facing a problem that's poorly defined or outside of your expertise, you can quickly learn what you need to dig in, make sense of the problem, and start working towards a solution
• You're a great communicator, and can advocate for your proposals while also empathizing with your teammates' goals and priorities
• You understand that security work must be prioritized because all teams have finite resources. You have good judgment and a sense of when to compromise and when to hold your ground
• Understanding of computer network security or major computer networking protocols (e.g. TCP/IP, HTTP, TLS, DNS).
• Nice to haves:

• Experience with Amazon Web Services (AWS) or any other major cloud service provider
• Kubernetes and container security and running fleets of endpoints or servers in the cloud.
• Cryptography, PKI, or key distribution
• Running multi-tier or distributed web applications at scale

Benefits:• Great medical, dental, and vision insurance options
• Mental health benefits
• Family building benefits
• In addition to 12 observed holidays, salaried team members have unlimited paid time off, hourly team members have 15 days paid time off
• 401(k) plan to help save for your future
• 18 weeks of paid parental leave. Biological, adoptive, and foster parents are all eligible
• Pre-tax commuter benefits
• Lyft Pink - Lyft team members get an exclusive opportunity to test new benefits of our Ridership Program
